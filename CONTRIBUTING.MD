## Code Guidelines

Follow these coding standards for consistency:
1. **Formatting**: Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting.
   ```bash
   rustfmt src/*.rs
   ```

2. **Linting**: Ensure clean code using `clippy`.
   ```bash
   cargo clippy
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Use `Result` and proper error handling instead of panics.

4. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new features and edge cases.

5. **Naming**: Use snake_case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for types.

6. **Documentation**: Add comments and Rust docstrings (`///`) for public modules and functions.

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR targets the **main** branch.
2. Include a concise description of the changes.
3. Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
4. Ensure the code compiles without errors or warnings.
5. Write or update tests, if applicable.
6. Add documentation if needed.

Once submitted, maintainers will review your PR. Be open to feedback and iterate as necessary.

---

## Testing

Run tests locally using Cargo:
```bash
cargo test
```

For any new feature, write tests in the corresponding file under `src/protocol/`.

---

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally:
1. Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkySingh04/DNS-Server-Rust/DNS-Server-Rust.git
   cd DNS-Server-Rust
   ```
3. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. Test the DNS server using `dig`:
   ```bash
   dig @127.0.0.1 -p 2053 google.com
   ```
